This example show the use of particles with a 2D camera, and how to order rendering relative to other 2D meshes.

The square mesh moves back and forth perpendicular to the screen (Z axis), but doesn't appear to move because of the orthographic projection. The particle effect remains at Z=0. When the square moves in front, the particles render behind it, and vice-versa.
