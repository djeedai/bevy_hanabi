/// Create an animated sprite sheet texture.

/// Create a texture composed of individual sprites of size `size` pixels,
/// arranged into a grid of `grid` size into the texture image. The final image
/// has a pixel size of `size * grid`.
///
/// The texture is based on a 3D Perlin noise scaled with `scale.xy`. Each
/// sprite is a layer at a different height, scaled by `scale.z`, giving the
/// impression of animation.
///
/// The final image is convoluted by a falloff disk to ensure the square border
/// of the texture are hidden. Instead the texture appears roughly circular.
///
/// This produces an R8Unorm texture where the R component is equal to the
/// opacity, to be used with the [`ImageSampleMapping::ModulateOpacityFromR`]
/// mode of the [`ParticleTextureModifier`].
///
/// This code is a utility for examples. It's nowhere near efficient or clean as
/// could be for production.
