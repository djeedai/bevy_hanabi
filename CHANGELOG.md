## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add `SizeOverLifetimeModifier`.
- Add `PositionCircleModifier` to allow spawning from a circle or disc.
- Revamped spawning system:
  - `SpawnMode` is gone; `Spawner`s are constructed with associated functions `new`, `once`, `rate`, and `burst`.
  - Spawners can be reset with `Spawner::reset`. This gives control over when to spawn a burst of particles.
  - Spawners can be activated or deactivated with `Spawner::set_active`.
  - `ParticleEffectBundle`s can be initialized with a spawner with `ParticleEffectBundle::with_spawner`.

### Fixed

- Fixed depth sorting of particles relative to opaque objects. Particles are now correctly hidden when behind opaque objects.
- Fixed truncation in compute workgroup count preventing update of some particles, and in degenerate cases (`capacity < 64`) completely disabling update.
- Made the `GradientKey<T>::ratio` field private to avoid any modification via `Gradient<T>::keys_mut()` which would corrupt the internal sorting of keys.
