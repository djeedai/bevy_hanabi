/// Settings for an [`EffectSpawner`].

/// A [`SpawnerSettings`] represents the settings of an [`EffectSpawner`].

/// defines a pattern of particle spawning as the repetition of a number of unit
/// cycles. Each cycle is composed of a period of emission, followed by a period
/// of rest (idling). Both periods can be of zero duration.
///
/// The settings are:
///
/// - `count` is the number of particles to spawn over a single cycle, during
///   the emission period. It can evaluate to negative or zero random values, in
///   which case no particle is spawned during the current cycle.
/// - `spawn_duration` is the duration of the spawn part of a single cycle. If
///   this is <= 0, then the particles spawn all at once exactly at the same
///   instant at the beginning of the cycle.
/// - `period` is the period of a cycle. If this is <= `spawn_duration`, then
///   the spawner spawns a steady stream of particles. This is ignored if
///   `cycle_count == 1`.
/// - `cycle_count` is the number of cycles, that is the number of times this
///   spawn-rest pattern occurs. Set this to `0` to repeat forever.
